# Jumpy-Drone
Jumpy Drone is a short 2D puzzle platformer made in Unity. The main mechanic involves using the character's canon to fire projectiles at buttons, which move platforms and open doors. This was a solo project for my 2D Game Development course, where the games were encouraged to be non-violent to explore other genres and art styles in games.
